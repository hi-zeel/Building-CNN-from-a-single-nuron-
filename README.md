# My Journey into Neural Networks and CNNs

This repository is a reflection of my learning path into the world of deep learning.  
I started with the most fundamental concept: **the neuron** â€” and gradually built up towards **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which are the backbone of modern computer vision.

## ðŸ“˜ Chapter 1: What is a Neural Network?
Notebook: [`Neural_Network.ipynb`](./Neural_Network.ipynb)

In this notebook, I explored:
- The basic building block: **the artificial neuron**.
- How inputs, weights, bias, and activation functions come together.
- Step-by-step construction of a **simple feedforward neural network**.
- Training with gradient descent and understanding **loss functions**.
- Visualizing how neurons learn to approximate functions.

This was my first step, where I moved from pure theory into actual implementation.

## ðŸ“— Chapter 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) â€“ Step by Step
Notebook: [`CNNs.ipynb`](./CNNs.ipynb)

After understanding fully connected networks, I took the next leap into CNNs.  
Here I learned:
- Why fully connected networks struggle with images.
- The idea of **local receptive fields, convolution, and feature maps**.
- Pooling layers and their role in reducing dimensionality.
- Building a **CNN architecture step by step**.
- Training on image data to recognize patterns.

This chapter marks the moment where my neural network knowledge connected with **computer vision** applications.

## ðŸŒ± Reflection

- I began with neurons as abstract math functions.  
- Then I learned how to combine them into networks that can be trained.  
- Finally, I explored CNNs, where theory meets practice in handling real-world image data.

This journey is ongoing â€” the notebooks here are not the end, but the foundation.  
Next, I aim to explore **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and modern architectures** to continue building on this knowledge.
